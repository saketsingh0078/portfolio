        <h1 className="text-[1.3vw]">
          My journey into programming began during my academic years, starting
          as a curious exploration and growing into a deep passion for frontend
          development with React. I've developed various dynamic applications,
          honing my skills along the way.
          <br />
          <br />
          Transitioning from frontend to full-stack development, I embraced the
          MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). When I'm not
          coding,I enjoy spending time with my family and occasionally gaming.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I'm diving into the world of animations and mastering
          TypeScript, driven by my commitment to continuous learning and staying
          current in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
